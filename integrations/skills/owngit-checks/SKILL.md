# OwnGit checks

Use this skill inside an already active coding session that the user has
permitted to run project commands. It does not start, resume, or change a
session, model, or team, and it does not install anything. Follow the user's
existing project and team instructions; this skill does not replace them.

## Prerequisites

Inspect the supplied and project-known facts first: the installed `owngit`
binary, the server origin, the repository identifier, and the helper credential
file. Ask the user only for missing choices that belong to them. Do not ask the
user to re-enter a fact that is already available.

The credential file is owner-readable and contains an OwnGit-scoped helper
token, not a provider subscription token. Never pass the token as a command
argument, write it into a document, or print it in a log.

Inside a clone whose `origin` remote is the OwnGit clone address
(`http(s)://HOST[:PORT]/git/ID.git`), you may omit `--server` and
`--repository`. The helper reads them from `origin` and names them on standard
error. It sends the credential to that server only when the credential file's
first line names it (`owngit-server: ORIGIN`); otherwise it stops with
`credential_origin_required` or `credential_origin_mismatch`. Do not add or
change that line yourself. Report the error and ask the user.

Do not add `--accept-insecure-http` on your own. Plain HTTP is unencrypted, and
the user must accept that risk for the private connection.

## Workflow

1. Create one stable task for the unit of work. Reuse its identifier across
   revisions instead of creating a new task for every commit.

   ```sh
   owngit check task new \
     --server SERVER --repository REPOSITORY \
     --credential-file CREDENTIAL_FILE \
     --title "TITLE"
   ```

2. Run the checks. Prefer the project's committed configuration by omitting
   `--check`: the helper then runs only the checks in the `.owngit/checks.json`
   committed in the revision being tested. Pass explicit `--check name=command`
   values only when the user asks for a specific command or the revision has no
   committed configuration (`checks_not_configured`).

   ```sh
   owngit check run \
     --server SERVER --repository REPOSITORY \
     --credential-file CREDENTIAL_FILE \
     --task TASK_ID
   ```

3. Read the JSON result and the process exit code. Report the attempt status,
   the tested revision, the worktree state, the per-check results, and the
   remaining correction cycles. Report remaining cycles only from `task` in an
   uploaded run or from `check status`.

4. If a check failed and the user asks for a correction, reserve one round
   before asking for the correction, then pass the `cycle.id` from the reserve
   response as `--cycle` to the verifying run. A correction already authorized
   in the active task may continue within the budget without asking again. Do
   not start an unrequested fix.

   ```sh
   owngit check cycle reserve \
     --server SERVER --repository REPOSITORY \
     --credential-file CREDENTIAL_FILE --task TASK_ID

   owngit check run \
     --server SERVER --repository REPOSITORY \
     --credential-file CREDENTIAL_FILE \
     --task TASK_ID --cycle CYCLE_ID
   ```

5. Read durable state with `check status --task TASK_ID`,
   `check log --attempt ATTEMPT_ID`, and `check cycle list --task TASK_ID`.
   `check config show` shows the configuration recorded most recently from any
   branch; it is not what `check run` uses.

## Reading the result

`check run` prints one JSON object and exits with a code:

- `0`: every check passed. Read `registered` and `uploaded` to see whether the
  attempt was recorded; a local `--no-upload` run also exits 0.
- `1`: at least one check did not pass.
- `2`: this client could not confirm that the attempt was recorded.
- `130`: the run was cancelled.

An error object (`{"ok":false,"error":{...}}`) with exit code `1` instead of a
result means nothing ran and nothing was recorded: an argument was invalid, the
committed configuration is missing or invalid, or the server refused the
registration, for example an unreserved `--cycle`. Report the error code; do
not read it as a failed check.

Fields to report:

- `ok`, `registered`, `uploaded`, `attempt_id`, `cycle_id`.
- `task.correction_cycles_used`, `task.correction_cycles_remaining`. Read the
  budget from the `task` object only. The top-level
  `correction_cycles_remaining` is filled in from a server response, so when no
  response set it, it prints `0` because the field has no "unknown" value.
  A result with no `task` object, such as any `--no-upload` run or a failed
  registration, has an unmeasured budget. Run `check status --task TASK_ID`
  instead, and never read that `0` as an exhausted budget. `--no-upload` left
  the server task unchanged. A failed registration may or may not have been
  accepted already, so its outcome is unconfirmed: do not call the task known
  to be unchanged, and do not call it known to have changed.
- `attempt.status`, `attempt.revision_oid`, `attempt.worktree_state`,
  `attempt.cleanup_failed`.
- `results[].name`, `results[].status`, `results[].exit_code`,
  `results[].cleanup_error`.
- `upload_error` when this client could not confirm the registration or
  completion. The server may still have accepted it, so inspect `check status`
  before repeating a reservation or a run.

Per-check statuses are `passed`, `failed`, `error`, `cancelled`, `incomplete`,
and `unavailable`. A cleanup error makes the result `error` even when the
command exit code is visible. Output beyond the check's output limit makes the
result `incomplete`; a shortened excerpt or log is marked as truncated and does
not change the status. An empty configured set is `unavailable`, never `passed`.

## Limits

- Checks are advisory. They do not block a merge, and a passing check is not
  proof that the code is correct.
- The helper inherits the user's environment and permissions. It is not a
  sandbox.
- A dirty or unknown worktree is not a tested commit. Report the recorded
  worktree state instead of calling the revision tested.
- `--no-upload` runs locally and is not recorded on the server. Do not describe
  it as server-recorded evidence, and do not read its top-level
  `correction_cycles_remaining` of `0` as a budget. The server task keeps its
  own remaining rounds, attempt count, and sequence.
- A failed registration is unconfirmed, not absent. The attempt may already be
  recorded with the sequence advanced, or may never have arrived. Keep the
  stable task identifier, report the printed `attempt_id` as diagnostic
  evidence, and inspect `check status --task TASK_ID`. Do not rerun the check
  or reserve a round to find out. `check run` generates a new attempt
  identifier on every invocation and has no flag to resubmit an existing one,
  so a rerun cannot continue the unconfirmed attempt. If `check status` does
  not resolve that exact attempt, leave it unconfirmed and report it.
- An upload failure means this client could not confirm registration or
  completion. The server may still have accepted it. Inspect `check status`
  before repeating the operation; this is not a recorded failed check.
- The task budget is three correction rounds. Reserve a round before asking for
  a correction. The initial check and a manual rerun consume no round, and an
  unavailable or cancelled run does not create one by itself. Confirm
  exhaustion from `check status` or from a reserve call that returns
  `correction_budget_exhausted`, never from an unmeasured `0`. When the budget
  is exhausted, stop automatic continuation and report the unresolved task; a
  manual check can still be recorded.
- Do not retry a failed check blindly, and do not weaken or replace the
  committed check configuration to make a check pass.
- Do not launch or resume a coding session, change a model, grant tools to a
  read-only reviewer, reload a team, or inspect authentication files or
  transcripts.
- Skill loading is not a guaranteed callback. If the skill is not loaded, the
  user can invoke it explicitly or run the commands manually.
